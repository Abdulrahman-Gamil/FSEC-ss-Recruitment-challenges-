# FSEC-SS Recruitment Challenges

As an APU student studying **CS**, **Cybersecurity**, or a similar field, I have a strong desire to join communities to contribute and upskill. Unfortunately, I was not accepted for the **Challenge Creator** role. However, I created two challenges for the **FSEC-SS Recruitment**:

1. **Forensics**
2. **OSINT**

### Title: Hacker's Cookies  
**Description**:  
I met someone online who offered to teach hacking lessons through the dark web. He mentioned a private Discord server exclusively for those who complete his training program and become "professionals." Our communication is fully encrypted, and I haven’t been able to uncover his real identity or find an invitation link to the server.  

The only clue I have is that he loves cookies. He even sent me a picture of the cookies and reviewed it on the **8th of January, 2025**, giving it a **5 out of 5** rating. I’m wondering if this clue could help me track him down and access the server.  

**Flag format**: `FSEC-SS{flag}`
